###### [-->The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions<--]

> According to Havard challenge showed on [page](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T). It's necessary develop a Deep Learning App to be trained with 1000 images dataset, to identify what type of skin lesion is on picture select by the user. 
> Based on the information, data and instructions of the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) find bellow the app developed to the challenge.
